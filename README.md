# RAG

This repository contains practical experiments and small projects for learning Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

The goal of this repo is to understand RAG from the ground up — starting with embeddings and vector similarity, and gradually building toward full retrieval pipelines.

## What’s inside

This repo focuses on hands-on exploration of core RAG concepts, including:

- Text embeddings
- Vector similarity search
- Nearest neighbor retrieval
- Chunking strategies
- Simple retrieval pipelines
- Experiments with different RAG design choices
- ChromaDb
- Tools
- Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Each folder contains small, focused experiments rather than one large application.
